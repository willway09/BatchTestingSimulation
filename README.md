# BatchTestingSimulation

This is the Java simulation code corresponding to the Batch Simulation Comparison paper By Richard (Will) McCoy (willway09), Aryeh Silver (AriSilver1), and Sophia Keane (Sophia01717).

To compile, clone the repository, then run
```
make

```
in the root directory


To run, execute

```
java Main
```


Note that the simulation outputs to a SQLite database, for streamlined querying. We analyzed the data in R, using the RSQLite package, though due to the ubiquity of SQLite, either native access or a popular package should be available for your choice of data analysis technique.
